# Supplementary files for a research paper on behaviour of liquid droplets covered with magnetic nanosurfactant

COMSOL project files used for compulational fluid dynamics simulations of droplets covered with magnetic nanosurfactant and heated by laser radiation.

File `one_droplet__spot_on_the_bottom.mph` corresponds to Figure S7 in Supplementary materials: flows inside and outside of a single droplet when the region heated by the laser is located below the mid-level (“equator”) of the droplet.

File `one_droplet__spot_on_middle.mph` corresponds to Figure S8 in Supplementary materials: flows inside and outside of a single droplet when the region heated by the laser is located at the mid-level (“equator”) of the droplet.

File `one_droplet__spot_on_higher_place.mph` corresponds to Figure S9 in Supplementary materials: flows inside and outside of a single droplet when the region heated by the laser is located above the mid-level (“equator”) of the droplet.

Geometries depicted on Figure 4g, 4h and 4i corresponds to files
	`two_droplets__spot_in_between.mph`,
	`two_droplets__spot_on_the_left.mph`, and
	`two_droplets__spot_on_top.mph`,
respectively. In these geometries, two droplets are in contact with each other, and laser radiation heats different parts of the droplet surfaces.
