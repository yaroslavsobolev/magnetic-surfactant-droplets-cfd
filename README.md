# Project files for the fluid dynamics simulations described in the research article "Systems of mechanized and reactive droplets powered by multiresponsive nanosurfactants".

This is a repository of COMSOL project files used for computational fluid dynamics of the laser-induced rotation and translation of water droplets that were covered with multiresponsive surfactant and immersed in oil.

For more details, see the research article:

	Zhijie Yang, Jingjing Wei, Yaroslav Sobolev, Bartosz A. Grzybowski, "Systems of mechanized and reactive droplets powered by multiresponsive nanosurfactants", *Nature*, **2017**.
	
Here, I will reference figures from this article and its Supplementary materials text.

These project files are compatible with COMSOL Multiphysics version 5.1 or higher.

File `one_droplet__spot_on_the_bottom.mph` corresponds to Figure S7 in Supplementary materials: flows inside and outside of a single droplet when the region heated by the laser is located below the mid-level (“equator”) of the droplet.

File `one_droplet__spot_on_middle.mph` corresponds to Figure S8 in Supplementary materials: flows inside and outside of a single droplet when the region heated by the laser is located at the mid-level (“equator”) of the droplet.

File `one_droplet__spot_on_higher_place.mph` corresponds to Figure S9 in Supplementary materials: flows inside and outside of a single droplet when the region heated by the laser is located above the mid-level (“equator”) of the droplet.

Geometries depicted on Figure 4f, 4g and 4h in the main text correspond to files
	`two_droplets__spot_in_between.mph`,
	`two_droplets__spot_on_the_left.mph`, and
	`two_droplets__spot_on_top.mph`,
respectively. In these geometries, two droplets are in contact with each other, and laser radiation heats different parts of the droplet surfaces.
